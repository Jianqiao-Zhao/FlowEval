All the dialogue sessions of Controlable Dialogue were originally generated by three models from [See et al](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1170/). The dialogues are between human and the models. To determine the best hyperparameters for FlowEval, we randomly sample around 10% of the total dialogues to form a small valid set. We report the results of test set. For data split, please check `controllable_dialogue_split.json`.

We extend the original data with segment act annotation and dialogue evaluation. For more details, please refer to our paper and its appendix.
